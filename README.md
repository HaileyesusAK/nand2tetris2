C++ and Python implementation of the project works of Coursera's 
[Build a Modern Computer from First Principles: Nand to Tetris Part II](https://www.coursera.org/learn/nand2tetris2) course.

While part II of the course starts from chapter 7 of the book I have decided to include project 6 (Assembler) here just
for the sake of completeness.

Each directory is a standalone project whose description is extracted from [here](https://www.nand2tetris.org/course).

Some of the projects use tools downloaded from [here](https://www.nand2tetris.org/software) for testing.
